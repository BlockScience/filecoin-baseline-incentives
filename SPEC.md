### Initializing the `aggregate_sectors` historical data


#### Assumptions
- Network QAP is held constant during the initialization phase
- Storage and Consensus Pledge per Sector is held constant during the initialization phase

#### Sequence

1. Create AggregateSectors with equal sizes and with lifetimes varying from 0 days to 180 days
2. Set-up their collaterals to be constant values
3. Retro-simulate their reward schedules by assuming an constant share of the Network QAP
