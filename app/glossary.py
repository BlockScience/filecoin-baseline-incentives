## Glossary

### Raw Bytes Network Power (RB PiB)

Total network storage capacity. This is the sum of the total active onboarded storage by all miners and sectors.

### Block Reward

In a given period, the Block Reward is the sum total amount of Filecoin minted through Simple Minting and Baseline Minting mechanisms.

#### Simple Minting

A mechanism for issuing Filecoin as storage mining rewards through a function that decays exponentially with time.

#### Baseline Minting

Similiar to Simple Minting, but uses the concept of an "Effective Network Time," rather than the time since launch, for issuing rewards.

#### Effective Network Time (ENT)

A time-like measurement that captures, in effect, how the RB Network Power function tracks the Baseline Function. When RB Network Power is above the Baseline, ENT *tends* to move forward at the same rate as "real" time. Else, it *tends* to go slower. [1]

### Marginal Reward (MR)

Defined as the instantaneous Block Reward divided by the instantaneous RB Network Power. Indicates how much Filecoin is earned for a given unit of onboarded raw storage.

Marginal Reward Per Storage: $\omega(t) = \frac{BR(t)}{P_{rb}(t)}$

### Mining Utility (MU)

In order to make Marginal Reward comparisons relevant, it is important to contextualize these comparisons with respect to a common scenario. Mining Utility divides the Marginal Reward of any scenario against that common scenarioâ€”defined as the situation in which the RB Network Power is equal to the Baseline Function at every point in time (past, present and future).

Normalized Marginal Reward Per Power: $\pi(t) = \frac{\omega_s(t)}{\omega_b(t)}$
